<h2>Random Migrating Particles</h2>

<p>For this exercise, you will write code that simulates a set of particles moving
	randomly in a 2-dimensional space within a bounding box. The coordinates of the
	overall simulation box are between 0.0 and 100.0 along each dimension. The particles
	are divided among chares based on their coordinates. The chares should be organized
	in a 2-dimensional array of chares (using a chare array) of size <span lang="latex">k \times k</span>. So, each
	chare owns a bounding box of its own with size <span lang="latex">100.0/k</span>. The particles in each chare
	can be stored as a vector.</p>
	
<p>Your program should generate <i>n</i> particles per chare during construction with a
		random (but valid, i.e. within the chare) position for particles. Your program
		should accept the number of particles per cell <i>n</i>, and <i>k</i> as command line parameters
		in that sequence.</p>
		
<p><u>Expected Output</u>: Your program should calculate and print to screen the maximum and
	total number of particles every 10 iterations. Additionally, the simulation should
	not be delayed by this calculation (i.e. you should use reductions).</p>

<p>For testing your program, you can use 10000 (=<i>n</i>) particles per chare, simulated over 100 steps
	and a chare array of size <span lang="latex">16 \times 16</span> (<i>k</i>=16).  Experiment with different number of particles and
	chare array sizes.</p>

<p><u>Note</u>: There might be multiple particles having the same <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates, especially
	if you increase the density of each cell. You do not need to handle this case separately;
	it is a valid case assumption.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The pseudocode for the overall algorithm is:</li>
	<code>for(iteration=0; iteration&lt;ITERATION; iteration++){</code>
		<ul>
			<li>For each of the particles that belong to my chare: change its <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinate by a small random amount. 
				If this change causes the particle to move to an invalid coordinate, keep the particle in its original position.</li>
			<li>Move all the particles that do not belong to a chare's bounding box to their correct homes. 
				Since the movement is small, this will mean communication to the eight near neighbor chares. Some of these messages may contain no particles. 
				For both efficiency and ease of implementation, all communication with neighbor chares should happen at the end of an iteration rather than after each particle.</li>
			<li><code>if(iteration%10 == 0)</code></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Do reductions to calculate average and max number of particles</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<code>}</code>
</ul>

<p><u>Instructor's Note</u>: This exercise can be implemented in several ways, feel free to choose from the variations below or create your own based on your learning objectives:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Choose to move the particle along either the <i>x</i> <i>or</i> <i>y</i> axis using an additional random variable, which simplifies communication as there are now only four neighbor chares.</li>
	<li>If a movement causes a particle to move to an invalid coordinate, move in the opposite direction instead.</li>
</ul>
